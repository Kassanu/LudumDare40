As you collect more gold your bag gets heavier and larger reducing your speed. Try to stay alive as long as possible.

Movement: WASD/Arrow Keys

The idea for this game was thinking about how heavy your inventory would be in other games. I had the image of your character dragging around a giant bag with a rope and getting harder and harder to drag it along as you collect items and money.

The bag getting larger and harder to move around makes it easier for you to be killed however the larger the bag gets it does offer some protection which I thought was interesting. I would have liked to add things to buy, then you would have to balance saving money to get really good items vs spending it to remain light and agile.

Going forward I think this game could evolve into a roguelike. Diving into dungeons and dragging back all the loot could be fun as you would need to decide if taking items and gold was worth the burden while walking back to town to sell.
